                      As early as the 50s of the twentieth century, interior designers began to actively equip abandoned storage facilities.
                      The production facilities differed from the layouts of ordinary housing, which led to an interesting synthesis in design.

                                the interior here requires large spaces, very high ceilings, huge windows and lots of natural light;

                                wall design – masonry or imitation of stone trim. A concrete screed and laminate are laid on the floor, the ceiling is decorated with floor beams for greater similarity with the production workshop;

                                the lighting is as natural as possible, so the windows are almost always not curtained. For artificial lighting, spots, and sconces in a thematic style are used;

                                large sizes of rooms, the height of the rooms plays a particularly important role; Since massive classic furniture is used, then low ceilings would look caricatured. The strict geometry of the premises is also crucial;
                                colors – pastel, beige, and cream shades;
                            </li>

                                for the arrangement of floors a parquet board or laminated wood panel will be a perfect fit, the walls are glued with heavy wallpaper, most often vinyl or textile. The ceiling is painted white, and framed by restrained stucco molding along the contour;
                                luxury, wide furniture is used in a classic style;

                                lighting is set by one main massive chandelier. In addition, wall sconces are used;

                            <li>
                                decorative elements – a large mirror in an original wooden frame, paintings with classic themes, glass vases, plaster figurines.

                                Classicism is characterized by certain congestion of space, which is favorable for leisurely social conversations.
